I'm going to give you the skeleton code of a Python program.
Your task is to implement the missing parts of the code.
Wrap your response in a code block using three backticks (```) at the beginning and end.
Output format:
{% raw %}
```python
{{ your code here }}
```
{% endraw %}

# Skeleton Code
```python
{{ skeleton }}
```
