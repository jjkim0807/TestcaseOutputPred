I'm going to give you a python code and its execution result.
Please determine whether the execution is successful or not and explain the reason.
If the execution is successful, status is "success", otherwise "failed".
The format is python code block with a dictionary as follows:
{% raw %}
```python
{
    "status": {{ status }},
    "explanation": {{ explanation }},
}
```
{% endraw %}


# Executed Code
```python
{{ exec_code }}
```

# Execution result
```plaintext
{{ exec_result }}
```
