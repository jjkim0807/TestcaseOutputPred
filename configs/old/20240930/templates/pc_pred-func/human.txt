# Instruction
I'm going to provide you a coding problem.
You need to write a pseudocode based on the problem.
Here are some conditions.
- The output should be written in a separate code block using three backticks (```) at the beginning and end.
- The pseudocode should be middle level abstraction pseudocode.
    - The simplified part should be a function call with meaningful name in these format:
        - var1, var2, ... = func1(var3, var4, ...) # comment
        - func2(var5, var6, ...) # comment
    - The comment should be a one-line description of what the code does.
    - The comment should explain the purpose of the function. Do not just say "Process the queue" or "Initialize the queue". Explain what the queue is used for, or what the queue contains.
    - You don't need to implement the simplified functions, just write the function calls with meaningful names.
