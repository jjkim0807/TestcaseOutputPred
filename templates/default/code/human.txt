I'm going to give you the skeleton code of a Python program with natural language pseudo-code as comments. 
Your task is to implement the missing parts of the code.
Wrap your response in a code block using three backticks (```) at the beginning and end.
Output format:
{% raw %}
```python
{{ your code here }}
```
{% endraw %}

# Skeleton Code with Natural Language Pseudo-Code
```python
{{ plan }}
```
