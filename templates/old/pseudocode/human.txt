# Instruction
I'm going to provide you a coding problem.
You need to write several pseudocodes to solve the problem.
Here are some conditions.
1. The pseudocode will be abstractly debugged by the AI, so define the variables and functions properly without specifying all the details too specifically.
2. Add line numbers to the pseudocode.
3. Wrap your response in a code block using three backticks (```) at the beginning and end.

# Output Format
