# Instruction
{% raw %}I'm going to give you a coding problem, a Python program, and some testcases for it.
Your task is
1. to find necessary imports for the given code and write them in python format.
2. to convert the testcases into Python assertions.
Here are some conditions.
1. The given code can be wrong, but you should not modify it.
2. The given testcases are just string, so you need to convert them into Python assertions.
3. The generated assertion should compare the expected output and the actual output.
4. You should not include the target code in the final output. Just provide the converted assertions.

# Output format
```json
{
    "imports": "{{ imports }}",
    "assertions": [
        "{{ assertion }}",
        ...
    ]
}
```{% endraw %}

# Inputs
## Problem Description
```plaintext
{{ question }}
```

## Target Code
