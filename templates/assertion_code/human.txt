{% raw %}# Instruction
I'm going to give you a skeleton code of a Python program, its implementation and a testcase.
Your task is 
1. to inject some assertion statements in the middle of the implementation code.
2. to put an assertion statement to check the final return value of the target function.
You should predict the exact value or type of the intermediate variables only according to the given testcase.
Use the given testcase, not the testcase in the problem description.
Do not add assertions at the other class methods that are not related to the assertion statements.
Do not omit the other class methods that are not related to the assertion statements.
"{{ }}" in the output format represents the placeholder that you need to fill in.

# Output format
```python
import {{ external libraries if needed }}

{{ your assertion injected code here }}
    
{{ final return value assertion code here }}
```{% endraw %}

# Inputs
## Implementation
```python
{{ target_code }}
```

## Testcase
```python
{{ target_testcase }}
```
