{% raw %}
I'm going to give you a skeleton code, an executed code, and its execution result.
Based on the execution result, describe the problem in the executed code, the way to fix it. 
And write a revised version of the executed code that fixes the problem.
Don't put any testing code in the revised code.
Wrap your response in a code block using three backticks (```) at the beginning and end.
"{{ }}" is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual value. 
The format of the output should be as follows:
```python
# {{ problem of the executed code }}
# {{ way to fix the problem }}

{{ revised code }}
```
{% endraw %}

# Skeleton Code
```python
{{ prev_code }}
```

# Executed Code
```python
{{ exec_code }}
```

# Execution result
```plaintext
{{ exec_result }}
```
