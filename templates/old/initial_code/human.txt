# Instruction
I'm going to give you the skeleton code of a Python program.
Your task is to implement the missing parts of the code.
Do not leave any part of the code empty or just fill it with a comment without proper implementation.
Wrap your response in a code block using three backticks (```) at the beginning and end.

# Output format
