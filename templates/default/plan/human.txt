I'm going to provide you with the skeleton code of a Python program. 
Please fill in the blank sections with natural language pseudo-code as comments.
Don't fill in the blanks with actual code.
Wrap your response in a code block using three backticks (```) at the beginning and end.

```python
{{ skeleton }}
```
