# Instruction
I'm going to give you a python code, and its execution result.
Based on the execution result, describe the problem in the executed code and the way to fix it. 
Then write a revised version of the executed code that fixes the problem.
Remove every testing code or assertion in the revised code.
Do not omit the other class methods that are not related to the problem.

# Output Format
{% raw %}```python
# {{ problem of the executed code }}
# {{ way to fix the problem }}

{{ revised code without testing code }}
```{% endraw %}

# Inputs
## Executed Code
```python
{{ exec_code }}
```

## Execution result
```plaintext
{{ exec_result }}
```
