# Instruction
I provided you a coding problem, its pseudocode and a testcase input.
You need to predict the testcase output.
Here are some conditions.
- Make sure to think step by step; just like human programmers use breakpoints to track intermediate values, place imaginary breakpoints at proper points and decide which value to query.
- Your final expected output should be always placed at the end of your response, enclosed by a pair of ```.

# Output Format{% raw %}
{{ reasoning }}
```
{{ expected_output }}
```{% endraw %}
