# Instruction
{% raw %}I'm going to give you a Python program and a testcase input and output pair.
Insert the testcase input and output pair into the Python program after converting them into Python assert statements.
And then, make the program in a form that can be run immediately, including the given code.
Wrap your response in a code block using three backticks (```) at the beginning and end.
"{{ }}" is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual value. 
The format of the output should be as follows:
```python
{{ main code }}

EXPLANATION = '{{ explanation }}'
OBJECT = {{ object_class }}({{ object_params }})
TARGET_FUNC = OBJECT.{{ target_func }}
INPUT = {{ input }}
OUTPUT = {{ output }}

try:
    result = TARGET_FUNC(INPUT)
except e:
    print(f"Input: {INPUT}, Expected: {OUTPUT}, Got Error: {e}")
    raise e

assert result == OUTPUT, f'Input: {INPUT}, Expected: {OUTPUT}, Got: {result}'
```{% endraw %}

# Target Code
```python
{{ revised_code }}
