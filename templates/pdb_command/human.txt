{% raw %}# Instruction
I'm going to give you a skeleton code of a Python program, its implementation and a testcase.
Your task is to generate a pdb command to check the intermediate variables and the final return value of the program.
You should predict the exact value or type of the intermediate variables only according to the given testcase.
Use the given testcase, not the testcase in the problem description.
"{{ }}" in the output format represents the placeholder that you need to fill in.

# Output format
```json
{
    "explanation": "{{ explanation }}",
    "pdb_command": "{{ pdb_command }}",
    "expected_output": "{{ expected_output }}"
}
```{% endraw %}

# Inputs
## Implementation
```python
{{ target_code }}
```

## Testcase
```python
{{ target_testcase }}
